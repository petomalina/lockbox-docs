# Identity Attributes

:::info

This feature is currently in private beta. If you are interested in trying it out, please contact us.

:::

Identity attributes allow you to assign attributes to identities. This is useful when you want
to define roles for a group of identities, or when you want to assign additional metadata to an identity.

## Attributes

Attributes are key-value pairs that you can assign to an identity. For example, you can assign an attribute
`department: engineering` to an identity `john@example.com`. This attribute can then be used to define roles for all
identities with the `department: engineering` attribute.

## Dynamic Bindings

Dynamic bindings are bindings that are created based on the attributes of an identity. For example, you can create a
dynamic binding that assigns the `projects.owner` role on a resource path `/accounts/account-1/projects` to all
identities with the `department: engineering` attribute.

This allows you to define roles for groups of identities based on their attributes, without the need to create bindings
for each individual identity. This is especially useful when you have a large number of identities and want to manage
roles for groups of identities efficiently.

## Use Cases

Here are some common use cases for identity attributes:
- Assign roles to **groups of identities** based on attributes such as department, team, or location.
- Assign additional metadata to an identity, such as incident management schedule.
- Define roles for identities based on their attributes, without the need to create bindings for each individual identity.
