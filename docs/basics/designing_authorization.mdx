# Designing Authorization

This guide will walk you through the core concepts of Lockbox, using a Todolist tracker as an example.
Imagine you're a freelancer managing multiple projects with tasks, and invoices. Each project
belongs to an account (personal or organizational). Let's explore how Lockbox helps you control access to these resources.

## Understanding the Resource Structure

Resources are composed in a tree structure. In our Todolist tracker, the root resource is the account.
Each account can have multiple projects. Each project can have multiple tasks and invoices. This tree structure 
allows for granular control over the permissions without the need to define permissions for each individual resource.

In the example above, a path to e.g. Task-1 would be `/accounts/account-1/projects/project-1/tasks/task-1`. 

## Roles & Permissions

In Lockbox, roles are a collection of permissions. We define roles for different resources using flat strings
containing the resource name and the permission. For example, a role for an account owner might look like
this: `accounts.owner`. For the projects, even though they are part of some account, we define such role as
e.g. `projects.owner`. This allows us to bind the role to any resource in the resource tree.

Each role can have multiple permissions. For example, the `projects.owner` might look like this:
- `projects.read`
- `projects.write`
- `tasks.read`
- `tasks.write`
- `invoices.read`
- `invoices.write`

Other roles, such as `projects.viewer`, might only have the `projects.read` and `tasks.read` permission. You can then bind this role to the whole account or to a specific project.

## Identities

Identities within Lockbox are just strings with metadata. They can be anything from an email address to a UUID.
In our Todolist tracker, we can use email addresses as identities for people, and API key UUIDs as identities
for automation.

## Bindings

Binding is a unique triad of an identity, a resource, and roles. Bindings then define who can perform what actions
on a given resource and all its children. For example, you can bind the `projects.owner` role to the `/accounts/account-1`
resource for the identity `john@example.com` and this identity will have the permissions to read and write to all projects within the account.

You can translate each binding to a simple sentence: "John can read and write to all projects in account-1", or more precisely,
"john@example.com has the `projects.read` and `projects.write` permissions on the `/accounts/account-1` resource".
